<b>Op-Ed Contest Last Place: Trail Mix is Not That Good</b><br><strong>Leo Scott</strong><br><br>
I don't know what more you want me to write. It only tastes OK, so I don't know why all these nature idiots are hiking and shoving it in their holes. If you get lost on a hike, and must emergency camp overnight, and the only sustenance you have is a bag of trail mix, then yeah, I guess I would eat it. Or like if I hadn't gone grocery shopping in a few days and there was only like that and some soup in my cabinet, then I guess I would eat it then too.<br><br>
It's just nuts. Not like crazy, it's like peanuts and walnuts and stuff. I like those OK, but the sunflower seeds are bland and taste like my dad smells, and the raisins are really salty, I wish they were regular grapes. I know they can't put grapes in trail mix but I would like to see that one day. The only part that I eat voluntarily is the M&Ms. Those are really good. Put my mom gets mad when I pick out just the M&Ms, and when I do it near my friends they don't say anything but I know they think I'm weird.<br><br>
Trail mix makers also gotta get the balance right. If I was the CEO of trail mix it would just be M&Ms, but I get that that's not really the point of trail mix, it's supposed to have nuts in it. So I would put maybe 70% M&Ms, 25% Nuts, and 5% the long piece of chex mix. That's my favorite piece. Chex mix has really got this mix thing down and should teach trail mix a thing or two. When I went to New York City I bought some mix tape from a guy on the subway that was yelling really loud<br>
